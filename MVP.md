Galactic Trove
A Python Capstone project for DevMountain Python Specialization

Galactic Trove will be a Web application avalible to two different user types: Collectors and Stores.

All users will have the ability to Register, Login, and Logout.
Upon Registering users will be asked if they are signing up as a Collector or a Store.
Collectors:

Collectors will have access to the following two functions: "Collection Tracker" and "Buylist".
The "Collection Tracker" feature will allow the user to build a collection of all their "Magic the Gathering" cards.
The tracker feature will have the following user input fields: Card Name(autocomplete), Card Set(list autocomplete), Foil, Quantity, Quality
Once a card has been entered and added to the collection, the user will be able to see the value of the individual card and their total collection value.
The collection will be tied to the users account and have persistance if they logout or close the webpage.
The "Buylist" feature will allow the user to build a tracker of cards they wish to buylist(a buylist is a store providing a list of cards they are willing to buy at a set value).
The buylist feature will function similar to the Collection Tracker input fields.
Once a card has been entered and added to the buylist, the user will be able to see the value they can get of the individual card and their total buylist value.
The user will be able to then choose to proceed with the buylist, and a redirect will take them to TCGPlayer.com and input their list in their system.
Stores:

Stores will have access to the following two functions: "Inventory" and "Store Front".
The "Inventory" feature will allow the user to build a Inventory of all the "Magic the Gathering" Singles in their store.
This will function similar to the Collectors "Collection Tracker" feature.
The "Store Front" feature will be a Point of Sale system that the store can use when selling cards to customers.
The Store Front will be a system that allows the user to sellect the cards in their inventory and add them to a card.
Stores will have the ability to enter a preset for their system that sets a Flat Percentage Mark Up when adding cards to the cart.
Stores will also have the ability to manually adjust pricing in the cart.
When a sale is completed, the cards that where sold will be pulled from the Store Inventory automatically.
Future Features:
